                        We believe that with better information, grantmakers can be more effective
                            and strategic decision-makers. 360Giving provides support for grantmakers to publish their grants
                            data openly, to understand their data, and to use the data to create online tools that make grant-making
                            more effective. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/">360Giving</a>.

Having been to school, gone to youth group, travelled and shared a house together they often talked about  'giving back'. Robin's successful entrepreneurial career and Chris's learnings from working with several corporate foundations as part of his management consultancy career made this possible so they combined forces in 2009 and created ZING. Both are passionate about creating opportunities for young people to achieve their potential in life and share a desire to bring scalable web and mobile technologies to the not-for-profit sector.</p>

                            create a culture and system that sees every state schools and college supported by a
                            thriving, engaged alumni community. </br>

The programme not only provides young people with the hard skills they need to find work, but, crucially also tackles head-on the attitudes and behaviours that often hold them back.

                                the boardroom right through to the field. Since 1985,
                                we have trained, educated and supported young people
                                in South Asia and across Africa to bring about solutions.

                                health and their livelihoods.  We create the opportunities
                                for them to play active roles in policy and decision making,
                                and help them to address the most urgent problems facing their
                                countries.

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Inclusive Classrooms is a new charity looking to
                                transform the role of Teaching Assistants (TAs) in mainstream primary schools across the UK.

                            </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/plogos/InclusiveClassrooms_logo.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>
                               Inclusive Classrooms is the only UK based professional development programme that
                               focuses specifically on the role of Teaching Assistants. </p>
                            <p>
                                It is also the first professional development programme which makes the link
                                between academic achievement and social inclusion. Many schools are struggling
                                with how to make inclusive admissions work for them; increasing the number of
                                children identified with SEN in mainstream settings presents schools with a number
                                of challenges surrounding access, curriculum, staff roles and resources. Inclusive
                                Classrooms aims to alleviate some of these challenges by highlighting an effective
                                focus for TAsâ role, as well as presenting research-informed programmes that
                                improve the social inclusion and academic attainment of pupils identified with SEN.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If successful, this programme could revolutionise the role of TAs, an expensive and
                                much talked about resource in schools. Both Ofsted and the Department for Education
                                have recently launched national inquiries into the role of TAs, which highlights
                                widespread recognition that their role needs to be reconceptualised. This is the
                                ideal time for Inclusive Classrooms to launch.

                                Ark and NEON Foundation have joined forces to create a cloud-based
                                data platform for the education sector.  Zing Foundation is proud
                                to be a founding partner of the initiative and a member of its
                                steering group.

                                Ark is an international education organisation whose purpose is
                                to transform studentâs lives. In the UK,  Ark operates a network
                                of high-performing academies and has launched a range of education
                                programmes designed to increase studentsâ life chances.

                                But teaching is complex â becoming an expert isnât easy. Teachers deserve as much effort to go into their training as they put into their teaching. Thatâs why we are re-thinking teacher education and providing a progression pathway to expertise that is taught by a faculty of expert teacher educators.

                                Every day, 41 of the countryâs most vulnerable children are permanently excluded from school, and once excluded, only 1.5% of children will get a good pass in English and maths GCSEs. Nationally, 1 in 200 children is excluded from school, but 1 in 2 of the prison population was excluded when at school.

                                The Difference works to raise the status and expertise of those working with vulnerable learners: in Alternative Provision, and in mainstream. We identify exceptional teachers and match them to leadership positions in schools for excluded pupils. Over a two year placement, The Difference provides a specialist training programme for our <em>Difference Leaders</em> alongside their two-year leadership post. Our <em>Difference Leaders</em> gain specialist knowledge of national best practice in working with disengaged and vulnerable children, including in improving literacy rates and positive post-16 destinations, and improved support for mental health, safeguarding and effective multi-agency working.

                                The Differenceâs relationships with mainstream schools, including some of the biggest multi-academy trusts in the country, then allow us to broker a new career step for our <em>Difference Leaders</em> at the end of the two-year training programme. In this way, The Difference will cascade best practice in working preventatively, positioning its alumni to build capacity in mainstream schools to support vulnerable children <em>before</em> they are excluded.

                                Bringing people with different life experiences together to increase compassion, empathy and understanding.

                                The Roots Programme is a radical new initiative that believes our society benefits if we bring together people with hugely different lives in an authentic and meaningful way. We take people from different walks of life and have them meet and eat, talk and debate matters that affect us all. We will unite them and build understanding around their differences and, importantly, their similarities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To have a real impact, we need to do this for now and for the future. On the one hand, we work with people in positions of influence in our major institutions and leaders in the communities affected by their decisions. On the other, we work with state and private schools to have the creative, engaged future influencers of our country build bridges across socio-economic divides.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The programme is designed to do this within a supportive environment, harnessing the desire of those on all sides to seek insight, enlightenment and meaningful change â to show their roots and find out about those of others. The Roots Programme is there to facilitate workshops with all parties to lay the groundwork and ensure that there is meaningful change after the programme for the participants and their respective communities.

                                Every year, around 200,000 children donât achieve the expected standard in GCSE English and maths - these children are disproportionately from disadvantaged backgrounds.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The impact of this lasts a lifetime. Missing out on a grade C in GCSE English by one mark increases a young personâs chances of not being in education by 18 by a third. Without these gateway qualifications, as adults they can struggle to secure and stay-in employment or progress in the world of work.

                                Get Further supports students facing challenges in further education to improve their English and maths skills and gain key qualifications, so that they can realise their aspirations for education and work. We match students to a high-quality tutor â at no cost to the student â supported by a bespoke post-16 English and maths curriculum and resources that draw on the latest evidence in cognitive science to help students build their knowledge and confidence ahead of their exams. We also provide year-long, rounded support to students for independent study and strategies to boost motivation and help keep them on track.

                                Future First Global is a UK registered charity working to support school networks, NGOs and governments to build communities of relatable role models for young people, all over the world. Over the last five years we have spoken to school leaders and teachers in over 30 countries, and over 90% of them have said that building strong alumni communities can be valuable. Global polling indicates that over 50% of adults would be willing to give back to their former schools, and yet currently only 1% are doing so. We work to change that, by designing low-resource ways for schools and youth programmes to build networks of their former students or participants.

                                A few of the ways weâve seen former students support their schools in the last 12 months are:

                                    <li><strong>Supporting transitions</strong> - groups of alumni visit students who have dropped out of school in Rwanda to encourage them to go back to school</li>
                                    <li><strong>Mentoring</strong> - former students provide academic and pastoral mentoring for students in Sierra Leone</li>
                                    <li><strong>Teacher motivation</strong> - former students in Rwanda show teachers and students how they use classroom skills and theory in their jobs</li>

It is simple but effective and sees young people come together in little teams and, with the support of their Key Facilitator (youth worker trained to deliver the framework), think, plan, budget, pitch (to panel), do and review their very own youth-led projects. All they ask is for young people to engage their individuality, curiosity and creativity as they dream up their projects and work together to make it happen for real.

                                Lighthouse children's homes combine a strong education ethos, a stable home and excellent therapeutic support from outstanding professionals

                                Every year we see that the outcomes for children in childrenâs homes are poor and not improving. 62% have a diagnosable mental health condition, 61% are in alternative provision and 17% are subject to a conviction, final warning or reprimand while in a childrenâs home.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At Lighthouse we believe that education is fundamental to breaking this link between demography and destiny. We place a strong emphasis on education and we take a keen interest in our children's educational progress.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the heart of our approach is our people. We work to recruit and train talented graduates and experienced residential care workers to support the most vulnerable young people. We use a model of practice known as social pedagogy which is the model in place in most of Western Europe. We believe that our approach will lead to more stable placements, happier children and ultimately, better life outcomes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Children growing up in residential care can go on to live full and fulfilling lives if they have the right support. With excellent people, a stable place that feels like home and shared values and principles underpinning our work - all applied with a personal and caring approach - we believe that we can help young people to thrive, access opportunities and transform children's residential care in the UK.

                                Bite The Ballot is an international social enterprise that specialises in civic and community engagement. They have grown from an idea in a classroom to coordinating world-record breaking campaigns, changing laws and rebranding politics among young and socially-excluded communities.

                                For many, all thatâs needed to make poor civic engagement a thing of the past is making politics simple, breaking it down into issues, and most importantly, offering them the space to share potential solutions. Bite The Ballot has developed a four-step programme of engagement that aims to create and develop active citizens, and runs a range of party neutral programmes, including:

This has been played with tens of thousands of people in schools and community groups.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Verto</strong> - an interactive platform that plays short and informative videos to educate, prove and inspire awareness on social issues.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Decafe</strong> (Democracy Cafe) - trained facilitators gathering people around tables to host sessions on particular issues, guiding the discussions and in many cases, making people feel political for the very first time.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Advocacy</strong> - facilitating changemaking through their work as the secretariat of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Democratic Participation, which has a co-chair from each elected major political party that participates in Westminster.
