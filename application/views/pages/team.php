      <h2>Robin Tombs, <b>Founder</b></h2>
      <p>ZING is a private foundation that supports organisations who work with young people in challenging circumstances helping them develop the life skills, behaviours and confidence to unleash their incredible potential. ZING supports its partners with funding and access to external expertise with an increasing focus on technology. We are attracted by organisations with a proven business model that is scalable, sustainable, and responds cost effectively to a community/society need. Since 2010 we have invested over £1,500,000 to support our partners, provide extensive access to a panel of experts through the ZING Forum and develop two initiatives – ZINGIT and UP – that provide the not for profit community with access to a suite of cost effective software tools and broader technology services.</p>
