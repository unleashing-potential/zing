      <h1 id="hello">Our Partners</h1>
      <p>Our partner organisations are all run as <em>businesses</em>. They are innovative in their income generation, keep overheads in check, and rigorously measure their outcomes. It is not so important to us whether the partner is structured as a charity, a social enterprise or a business with social purpose/impact.</p>
      <p>We are attracted by organisations with a proven business model that is scalable, sustainable, and responds cost effectively to a community/society need.</p>
      <p>We are very privileged to be learning from our partners as to how best unleash the potential of the young people they work with.</p>
