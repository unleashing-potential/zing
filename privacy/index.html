                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Information you give to us.</strong> This includes your name, email address, phone number, and any other personal data freely volunteered when you contact us via the website. If you contact us by phone or via social media, or meet with us in person, we will record your details to facilitate follow-up. If we request personal sensitive information (such as health information), this is to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate you (for example, for an event), otherwise we will be clear about the sensitive information we are collecting and why.</li>
                        <li><strong>Information we collect through your use of our website.</strong> We collect information about how you interact with the content on our website, including whether you watch embedded content from third-party websites (for example, YouTube and Vimeo), and the links you click. We collect your IP address but we remove the last digits to protect your privacy. This means we only have region level information about your location. We also collect information about the device you use to browse the website, including browser type/version, and operating system.</ul>
                      </ul>

                      <h3 class="privacy">How do we collect your information?</h3>
                      <p class="list-intro">Most of the information we collect comes directly from you. We collect and process your information when you do the following.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Fill in and submit our website’s contact form.</li>
                        <li>Voluntarily complete a survey or provide feedback to us via phone or email.</li>

                        <li>Meet with us in person.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h3 class="privacy">How will we use your information?</h3>
                      <p class="list-intro">We collect your information so that we can:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>follow up on requests for support;</li>

                        <li>give tailored support and guidance (for example, funding or technical); and</li>

                      <p>We are committed to storing your information securely. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place physical and electronic measures to safeguard and secure it.</p>
                      <p>When we use other organisation’s services to support our work, we sometimes send and store the information we collect outside the European Economic Area (EEA), to carry out the activities described in “How will we use your information?”. The organisations we use who are outside the EEA either have the EU-US Privacy Shield certification, or we have standard EU model contract clauses in place.</p>

                      <h3 class="privacy">Marketing</h3>
                      <p>We will contact you with news and events if you are within our network, and have shared your contact details with us for the purpose of being contacted in this way. You can opt out of this communication at any time by replying and asking us to remove you from our mailing list, or contacting <img src="/img/privacy-email.png" alt="privacy at zing.org.uk" style="height:14px; width:131px; margin-bottom:0px;" />.</p>
                      <p>If you contact us through the website, we will not add you to any marketing lists you are not already a member of, unless we ask you separately - the purpose of the “contact us” form is solely to request our support.</p>
